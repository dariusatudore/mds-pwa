## Source Control

### For source control we used Git version control, and we pushed the commits in this repository. We also used several branches for better management of our code.

#

## Bug Reporting

### During our development process we encountered several bugs. Most of them have been solved without raising an issue.

### The list of documented bugs that are closed can be found [here](https://github.com/dariusatudore/mds-pwa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

#

## Build Tool

### Being that the backend and frontend of our app has been developed in JavaScript with Node.js we have used the npm to run both of our servers.

### We also used nodemon to aplly changes to the servers on save.

#

## Refactoring / Code Standards

### We did on major refactorin to our code following the merge of the backend with the frontend so that our app would follow ESLint Standards.
